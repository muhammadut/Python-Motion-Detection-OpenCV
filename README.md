# Python-Motion-Detection-OpenCV
This project is a detailed explanation on some of OpenCV's basic methods. I have expalined everything in great detail for you to follow along & use it for your own application. Basically, I used this as a part of a computer vision project that I did at my internship at Honda of Canada MFG. We tracked door carriers & as soon as motion was detected we used a object recognition model built in Tensorflow to start up & detect door grommets. It was a prototype system to automate quality checks on the manufacturing line.
