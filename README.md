# Python-Motion-Detection-OpenCV
This project is a detailed explanation on some of OpenCV's basic methods. I have explained everything in great detail for you to follow along & use it for your own application. 

Basically, I used this as a part of a computer vision project that I did at my internship at Honda of Canada MFG. 
We tracked door carriers with this. And as soon as motion was detectedm, we used another object detection model (built in Tensorflow) to  detect door grommets & side bolts. 
It was a prototype computer vision system to automate quality checks on the manufacturing line.
